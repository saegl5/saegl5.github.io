## Web Apps

### Create 加油 ("jiā yóu") Calendar

Google Web app for creating a calendar of recurring events that cycles the words "J Day," "I Day," "A Day," "Y Day," "O Day," and "U Day," except on weekends and holidays. Without an app script, one would need to create these events manually.

*Note: Requires permission to see, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar.*
