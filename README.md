## Web Apps

### Create 加油 ("jiā yóu") Calendar

Google Web app for creating a calendar of recurring events that cycles the words "J Day," "I Day," "A Day," "Y Day," "O Day," and "U Day," except on weekends and holidays. Without an app script, one would need to create these events manually.

*Note: Requires permission to see, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar.*

### Add 加油 ("jiā yóu") Events

Google Web app for creating recurring events on only certain letter days (e.g., on only "J Day's"). Without an app script, one would need to add these events manually.

*Note: Requires permission to see, edit, share, and permanently delete all the calendars you can access using Google Calendar.* 

(Permission is required in order to get calendar information and create event series. That is, to get all calendars, including calendar names and IDs, to get calendar events, including calendar titles, start times, full dates, years, months and days/dates, and to create event series chained by date. However, no personal information from users who interact with the Web app will be collected, stored, or processed by me; users' personal information stays with Google.)
