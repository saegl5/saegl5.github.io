`Hello world!` &#128075;  您好。My name is Ed.

I am an aspiring IT professional and an educator who enjoys learning and coding. My passion for technology and education drives me to continually learn, code, and share knowledge with others.

Below are some projects of mine that I would love to share with you. Also included are some resources I have found to be incredibly useful. Through my projects, I hope to not only showcase what I’ve created but also inspire and support others on their own paths in technology and education.

I also support the community by regularly contributing to open-source projects and engaging in collaborative development.

Enjoy!

### Web Apps

#### Create 加油 Calendar

Google Web app for creating a calendar of recurring events that cycles the words "J Day," "I Day," "A Day," "Y Day," "O Day," and "U Day," except on weekends and holidays. Without an app script, one would need to create these events manually. Built in JavaScript and HTML.

#### Add 加油 Events

Google Web app for creating recurring events on only certain letter days (e.g., on only "J Day's") of a 加油 calendar. Without an app script, one would need to add these events manually. Built in JavaScript and HTML.

<p style="font-size: 8pt">* Permission is required in order to get calendar information and create event series. That is, to get all calendars, including calendar names and IDs, to get calendar events, including calendar titles, start times, full dates, years, months and days/dates, and to create event series chained by date.

### Python Scripts

#### Sprite Template

Python script for creating a sprite. It is a starter for Python game development, based on what I learned from teaching computer science for a couple years.
